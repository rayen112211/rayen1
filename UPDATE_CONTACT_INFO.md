# ✅ CONTACT INFORMATION UPDATED

## Status: Completed

I have updated your professional structured data with the contact information you requested:

### Updated Details:
- **Email:** `rayenazizi112211@gmail.com`
- **WhatsApp:** `+39 328 676 2496`
- **Social Profiles:** Removed (as requested, to keep things private/simple for now)

### Why this is good for SEO:
By providing verified contact information in the code (JSON-LD), you help Google's "Knowledge Graph" link your name to real business contact points. This improves your **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) score.
